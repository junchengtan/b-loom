# b-loom

b-loom is a knocked down version of Loom but purely for Mac and with no Audio.
For those looking to implement this to include audio, there are workarounds with soundflower to help capture the desktop sounds.
For my own personal purposes, I did not require any audio for the videos I recorded so I did not implement those features.
